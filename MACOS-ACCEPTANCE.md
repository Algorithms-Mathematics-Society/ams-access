# MAC-01–MAC-10 acceptance handoff

Owner for native verification: @Rasesh2005. These issues stay open until the
required GUI evidence is recorded. Linux unit tests and browser fixtures do not
establish macOS installation, permission, kiosk or hardware behavior. Record the
commit, app version, macOS version, architecture and installation route for each run.

## MAC-01 / #196: installation and identity

The release workflow now verifies the final Mac bundle before collecting it for
publication: expected version, bundle ID, CPU slice, Developer ID signing team,
strict signature verification and Gatekeeper assessment. A rejected check stops
publication. The four portable regression cases exercise rejection paths; actual
Apple signing/assessment still requires the macOS release runner.

GUI checklist:
- [ ] Download the intended release normally, keep Gatekeeper/quarantine intact,
      install into Applications and launch as a standard user.
- [ ] Repeat clean installation and upgrade on every advertised architecture.
- [ ] Open via Applications, Spotlight and an existing Dock shortcut; Settings
      must show the expected version and the same installed app must open.
- [ ] Opening directly from the DMG should give the existing move-to-Applications
      guidance. Do not use quarantine removal or ad-hoc signing to pass this test.
- [ ] Interrupt a download, retry through the official route and verify a usable
      final installer. Record any prompt or launch failure exactly.

Technical evidence, if needed: run `python3 scripts/verify-macos-release.py`
with `--app`, `--version`, `--arch` (`arm64` or `x86_64`) and `--team` matching the
release. It only inspects the bundle; it does not alter security settings.

Scale: build-time validation adds no candidate requests or runtime polling.
